                The exciting digital world brings with it expanding channels of engagement with our stakeholders, both internally and externally. As a result, we often spend a lot of time and effort planning, designing and executing our digital activities. But how do we know if our efforts were fruitful? Was the activity a success? Did it reach its target and goals?

            <p> 
                Whether it is web social media, apps, podcasts or other digital channels, metrics are values that help us measure, track, report and improve the performance of our digital activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Metrics are often referred to as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), but there is a difference. A metric is a number, where a KPI is the meaning of that number. A KPI includes insights. It is an interpretation of the data. To determine a KPI, it is useful to compare the actual value of the metric you are tracking with the average value for that certain activity in the industry. This helps you understand what success looks like.

            <h3 className="mt-5">Choosing the Best Digital Metrics for your Project</h3>
            <p>
                Different digital channels and tools have different metrics, and it’s important to identify which metrics are most important to track for any given project. The metrics you choose should help you make more informed decisions to continuously improve performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the amount of available data is extremely large, you will need to choose wisely.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an example, important metrics to understand website performance include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Overall site traffic – how many unique visitors per week/month</li>
              <li>Bounce rate – how often are visitors immediately leaving or “bouncing” away from your website</li>
              <li>Page visits - how many pages do visitors view before they leave your site.</li>
            </ul>
            <Row className="video-container">
              <Col md={{ span: 8, offset: 2 }}>
                <div className="ratio ratio-16x9">
                  <iframe 
                      src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/646671611"

                      allow="fullscreen" 
                      allowFullScreen

                  ></iframe>
                </div>
              </Col>
            </Row>
            <h3 className="mt-5">Selecting Your Tools of Measurement</h3>
            <p>
                As you determine the metrics you need to assess digital performance, you may also need specific tools to be able to track them.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if your campaigns are just designed to increase awareness, then you Google Analytics has a lot to offer. But if you’re looking to dive deeper into specific channels and specific KPIs, then you might need a more specific tool, like Veeva CRM.
