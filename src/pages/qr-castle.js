            “Using QR video links on conference posters is an effective way of communicating the science, and video may be a preferable form of media for many conference attendees. It’s key to continuously improve the way we communicate data externally since it ultimately impacts patient care. Having QR video links on Gilead conference posters would be great as standard practice; especially recently with virtual conferences where there is no person-to-person interaction at the poster.”

            A QR code or "Quick Response" code is a type of barcode that contains a matrix of dots that can be scanned by your smartphone camera to open a webpage, send an email, access additional data or deliver an augmented reality experience.

                  QR Codes have a variety of applications, and one of the hottest right now at Gilead is to enhance and extend the content and reach of your conference poster.
              </p>
              <p>
                  By giving conference attendees an easy way to access a video, article, or podcast from the author or some other resource, your poster starts to feel like an interactive experience that appeals to different learning modalities. It’s a convenient and cool way to get the key information during or after the conference.

                  Hear how Damien Fagan, Associate Director Medical Affairs, HIV in Melbourne and his colleagues used QR codes to substantially increase the number of people who benefitted from their poster presentations.
