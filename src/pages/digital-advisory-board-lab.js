                <p> 
                    A traditional advisory board is an in-person gathering of physicians where we seek their input to help shape our strategies and research. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These events vary in the number of physicians participating and in duration, which ranges from a half day or evening to a full day or more. A digital advisory board serves the same purpose and has the same compliance requirements, but the gathering takes place virtually. 
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    Over the course of the pandemic, we’ve been experimenting and innovating. We now have three different types of digital advisory boards to suit different situations.

                      <p>
                          These are very similar to in-person advisory boards but they are virtual. We gather a set of advisors to provide their expertise and guidance for a half day or other short period. We use a virtual meeting platform and focus our discussions on a single topic or set of topics. GAP Connect is an internally developed virtual advisory platform that may be of interest to you. Please <a href="https://vimeo.com/483166427/f361761084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">click here</a> to find out more about the capabilities of GAP Connect.

                      <p>
                          These types of advisory boards allow you to collate real-time insights during a period of time that couple be weeks, months or a year. We use a virtual messenger platform to facilitate the discussions with the advisors. All participants are able to see and respond to everyone’s conversations within the platform.

                      <p>
                        Physicians on these advisory boards engage for 6 months, a year or more, providing feedback and input on a variety of topics with a combination of synchronous and asynchronous interactions. These Advisory Boards are excellent when we need input at various stages of our research.
